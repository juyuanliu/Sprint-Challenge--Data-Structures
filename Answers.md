3. Hash tables, on average, take less time complexity over different methods, due to the constant,
   as opposed to arrays which is linear; therefore, with larger arrays, more time would be taken while
   the hash table would remain constant. While arrays use indexes to locate the element, which can be inefficient
   if you don't know the index containing the element, hash tables can return the value you're looking for
   by supplying the key. Hash tables seem to be more efficient to use, overall, than arrays when it comes to handling
   large amount of information despite the complexity of writing a hash table versus an array.
